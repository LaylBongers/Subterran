Subterran is an open source 3D game engine written in C#.

### Getting Started

Subterran can be downloaded in binary form [from AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/LaylConway/subterran/build/artifacts), or as source via git:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/LaylConway/Subterran.git
```

[No NuGet packages are available yet.](https://github.com/LaylConway/Subterran/issues/1)

The best way to get started with Subterran is to download *Subterran Basic* from AppVeyor and look at the [example projects](https://github.com/LaylConway/Subterran/tree/develop/Examples).
Unfortunately there is no [Getting Started](https://github.com/LaylConway/Subterran/wiki/Getting-Started) page on how to create your first game with subterran yet.
